Welcome to My GitHub

About Me

Hi there! I’m a student at Queen Mary University of London, currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics with Finance and Accounting. As part of my academic journey, I’m also taking a module on Programming in Python, which has led to the creation of this GitHub account.

What You'll Find Here

On this GitHub, I’ll be sharing various Python projects, exercises, and coursework related to my programming module. These will include topics such as:

Basic Python syntax and functions
Working with data structures
Algorithm development
Mathematical problem-solving using code
I’m excited to use this space to track my progress, collaborate on projects, and document what I’m learning in programming!
